In order to translate AvsPmod, you will need a file named "translation_lng.py", 
where "lng" is the three-letter code corresponding to the language that is 
translated to (see <http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php>).

If you are updating a translation from an older version, simply place the 
old "translation_lng.py" in the translations subdirectory and run AvsPmod.  
It will automatically update the translation file with all the new messages 
in the current version requiring translation.

If you are translating for the first time, simply place an empty text file 
named "translation_lng.py" in the translations subdirectory and run AvsPmod.  
Open the translation file in your text editor of choice, and read the 
instructions within to begin translating the program.
